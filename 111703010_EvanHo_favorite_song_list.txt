<<<<<<< HEAD
river flows in you
=======
I'm in love with the drugs, but they don't love me back
I'm in love with the pain, but you make it hurt so bad
You're the monster in my head tryna tell me how to act
You're a freak, set me free, give myself a heart attack
I got hate in my bones when my body's close to you
I hate sleepin' alone and I know you hate it too
You're a monster in my head tryna tell me how to act
You're a freak, set me free, give myself a heart attack

I'm off my face
Locked inside your prison, yеah
I'm off my face
Your love is my addiction
And I like to tastе
Yeah, I just can't resist it
But you're never gonna see me
Yeah, you're never gonna see me again

You are the thing that I crave when it's hard to sleep at night
I'll do anything for you, so just tell me what you like
You're the monster in my head tryna tell me how to act
And this love is gonna kill me, I will have a heart attack

I'm off my face
Locked inside your prison, yeah
I'm off my face
Your love is my addiction
And I like to taste
Yeah, I just can't resist it
But you're never gonna see me
Yeah, you're never gonna see me again

'Cause I do what I wanna do, what I wanna do, what I wanna do, ah
No rules when it comes to you, when it comes to you, when it comes to you
Play my heart like a bass drum
Break my neck like a killer
I'm dead, in fact, you're never gonna see me again

I'm off my face
Locked inside your prison, yeah
I'm off my face
Your love is my addiction
And I like to taste
Yeah, I just can't resist it
But you're never gonna see me
Yeah, you're never gonna see me again
